# Rock-Climbing-Rope-Drag-Simulator


Visit https://sites.google.com/view/relativelyrad/rope-drag-simulation/motivation-methods for more information on how the program works. 

Find rope drag for rock climbing routes on a vertical wall. Outputs total rope drag (lbs), rope drag due to friction, rope drag due to rope weight, a visual plot of the route, deflection angles of the rope at each bend, and more. Select from several different equations for friction, including an experimentally found equation. Assumes no friction from the rope touching rock, and zero tension at the belay.
